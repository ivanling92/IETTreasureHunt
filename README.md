#Sample Level 3: Map hunt!

Now, you've almost reached the end of the demo level!

We need you to do something. We need you to use google street view. 

We need you to tell the FB bot this:

What is the first Malay word that appears on the *red color sign board* located right outside SMK Sungai Maong, Kuching.

Click here to access maps: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Southampton,+UK/@50.913908,-1.4705327,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48738957be152909:0xa78c5a6a4cda71f0!8m2!3d50.9097004!4d-1.4043509

Send it to the FB bot in *all small letters* e.g. sekolah

Good luck!
